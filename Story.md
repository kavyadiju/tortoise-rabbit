Once there was a festival in that town and there was an eating competition going on. Rabbit ate 14 chocolates and the Tortoise gang said that our captian can eat more.

The rabbit rushed toward the finish line and at the end the Tortoise won by 1 seconds. And then both of the gangs became one. And the tortoise and the rabbit bacame friends again and king together!
